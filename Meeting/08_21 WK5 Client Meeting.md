| Content | Description | 
| :-----: | :------:    |
| **Location and Time**|   Law Library 4pm-5pm  21/08/2019  |
| **Purpose of Meeting**  |Provide feedback from first audit and ask the questions about the first preliminary design |\
| **Attendees** | **Project team**: Derek Tan, Andre Olivier, Minghui Zhang, Jiaying Ying **Client team**: Jeifei Wang (Robotic Engineer from Gottera), Martin Amidy (Goterra liason) |
| **Prepared by**  | Jiaying Ying| 
| **Reviewed by**  | All team members   |

## Agenda
- Establishing rendering Process
	* Specifics of the process (Wet process?)
- Establishing new information channels
	* Throughput of modern rendering plant
		- Specifications of the input: weight, size, water content etc.
		- Scaling of each plant equipment 
	* Feasibility of the equipment scaling 
		- What can we assume?
		- What capabilities are available?
		- What if equipment not made by 3rd party?
	* Can we prototype scientifically?
		- Proof of concept?

## Meeting Notes and Decisions 

1.	We asked for the design to be wet or dry process   An: what Gottera does is to use water to boil maggots first then vaporize it 
2.	We asked for the period expected to taken for each process  An: the answer is sort of answered through email throughput is 8 hours. Automatic is wanted for each stage of the process but not required for the overall process tradeoff with the label cost and machine maintainance and building cost
3.	Introduced our researches and the options to ask for the suggestions
4.	Why do we need pre-cooker  An: stage process to make the result being better to ensure the water is most out.
5.	Does the design need to be able process both fresh maggots and dehydranted maggots?  An: dead fresh maggots 
6.	Client is able to provide us some maggots to us for us to do some experiments on processing them.  Resources 
7.	Suggested by martin to get the dead maggots from university ethic regulations.
8.	The scale of the components   An: ask industries/manafacture who have sort of products to see if the size if feasible  For example: Alibaba 
9.	Prototype is not required and no needs to do it (checked with client), what they want is the detailed plant design in 3D regards to the feedbacks from tutor and shadow team. 
10.	Asking for visiting at the actual rendering plant regards to the feedback from tutor and shadow team. 
11.	The suggestions on the design clear about the functions of each components doesnâ€™t need to be pretty but need to be detailed.


- Waiting for the confirmation from Jeifei about the maggots experiments. 
- Waiting for the confirmation from Martin about the time and date to visit the industry which hasing working rendering machine.
