## 5. Outcome 
Based on the SWOT analysis, both GitHub and SharePoints has strengths and weaknesses. Consider there is no IP concerns in this project, one of the GitHub weakness related to no private repository can be neglected. GitHub allows user to use simple text editor to write formatted documents offers advantages in time saving. Thus, the development tool to develop repository is GitHub in this Project. 
Toward to the second weakness for GitHub, our group will assign tasks for each member and minimize the situation that members must need to edit one file at the same time.
