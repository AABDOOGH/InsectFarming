Team agreed to go with the information that client provided|
|4.2|4| 13/8/2019|Amount of input material in (kg)|Technical design |Decide size of each components|Client email 13/08|Approved| Project team and client | This is the benchmark for students|
|4.3|4|13/8/2019|Breaker output (mm^3)| Technical design| Define the breaker output and this will be used to determine the size of component| [TPM](https://github.com/JessYJY/insectfarming.github.io/blob/master/Research/FinancePreliminary.xlsx)| Approved| Project team | 20-25mm^3 is the target value (Reccomended by render tech to be around the units as described, this is the material that will now undergo processing ) | 
|4.4|4|13/8/2019|Pre-cooker temperature in Celsius| Technical design| Find out the requirement of temperature range of pre-cooker. This is one specification value for the pre-cooker in the design| [TPM](https://github.com/JessYJY/insectfarming.github.io/blob/master/Research/FinancePreliminary.xlsx)| Approved| Project team | 90-100 Celsius (Standard industrial temerpature at which material is heated to partially evaporate the material)| 
|4.5|4|14/08/2019| Pre-cooker presuure in Psi| Technical design| Define the requirement of pre-cooker pressure. This will limit the size of pre-cooker and therefore the deisgning for pre-cooker|[TPM](https://github.com/JessYJY/insectfarming.github.io/blob/master/Research/FinancePreliminary.xlsx)| Approved| Project team |target value is 10-15 Psi (Standard industrial pressure at which pre-cookers operate)|
|4.6|4|14/08/2019| Evaporater plant temperature in Celsius |Technical design| Define the requirement for evaporater plant. This is the design specification for evaporater plant|[TPM](https://github.com/JessYJY/insectfarming.github.io/blob/master/Research/FinancePreliminary.xlsx)| Approved| Project team |target value is > 100 Celsius (Standard industrial pressure at which pre-cookers operate)|

|4.8|4|15/08/2019|Continuous cooker tempearture| Technical design| Define the design specification for countinuous cooker and it will relate to the future size design part| [TPM](https://github.com/JessYJY/insectfarming.github.io/blob/master/Research/FinancePreliminary.xlsx)| Approved| Project team | ~ 120 Celsius (A chamber that rotates through the material, heating and evaporating the remaining water in the material )|Target value is <<<450 Celsius (Set by international bodies, the temperature specified is the recognzed minimum temperature at which envirmental objects may experience combustion. This is therefore the minimum temperature goal, however taking into account the human aspect (ie how vulnerable are humans) we may set this to a lower value)|
