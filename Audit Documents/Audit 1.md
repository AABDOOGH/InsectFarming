## 1. Project Vision 

This project aims to produce mobile and cost-effective rendering plant, capable of processing insects into meals and oils that meet regulatory requirements. The goal for this semester is to finish the designing part of the project.

### 1.1 Value proposition 

Population increases dramatically in recent years and it accompanies with increased consumption of food. One important component in human's dietary structure, protein, requires people to expand the soybean cultivation to feed livestock. One alternative solution is farm insect to provide an alternative food resource to livestock. The current regulations require the animal products which are used in agriculture feeds to be processed in the rendering plant. However, the existing rendering plant cannot process the insects in an economically way due to the small-scale nature of insect farming industry in Australia. Thus, this project is aiming to design a mobile, micro processing plant which can process insects cost-effectively.  

### 1.2 Project Scope 

The project scopes are divided into three parts and summarized below.
* Use CAD software to draw the schematic drawing of the designed micro-processing rendering plant. 
* Use FEA software to simulate the working process of the plant and make sure the designed plant can technically work properly and meet the requirements. 
* Conduct the economic analysis to find out the budget for building a prototype and a plant. 


### 1.3 Key achievement 
The expected key achievement in this project is designing and building a mobile and cost-effective rendering plant which can process and convert insects into oil and meal for livestock which can meet regulatory requirements.

### Contingencies

If everything goes well and the first 7 [Milestone](#Milestone) could be completed before the set timeline, the further more complex analysis with less limitations could be achieved and a scaled-downed prototype of the designed plant is another milestone. 

The initial generated progress of the project may effect by the many unpredicable and unexpected factors. Hence, the baseline of the project is finish the CAD design of the insect processing plant with all its funcationalities identified and dimensions detailed.
