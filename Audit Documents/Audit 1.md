## 1. Project Vision 

This project aims to produce mobile and cost-effective rendering plant, capable of processing insects into meals and oils that meet regulatory requirements. The goal for this semester is to finish the designing part of the project.

### 1.1 Value proposition 

Population increases dramatically in recent years and it accompanies with increased consumption of food. One important component in human's dietary structure, protein, requires people to expand the soybean cultivation to feed livestock. One alternative solution is farm insect to provide an alternative food resource to livestock. The current regulations require the animal products which are used in agriculture feeds to be processed in the rendering plant. However, the existing rendering plant cannot process the insects in an economically way due to the small-scale nature of insect farming industry in Australia. Thus, this project is aiming to design a mobile, micro processing plant which can process insects cost-effectively.  

### 1.2 Project Scope 

The project scopes are divided into three parts and summarized below.
* Use CAD software to draw the schematic drawing of the designed micro-processing rendering plant. 
* Use FEA software to simulate the working process of the plant and make sure the designed plant can technically work properly and meet the requirements. 
* Conduct the economic analysis to find out the budget for building a prototype and a plant. 


### 1.3 Key achievement 
The expected key achievement in this project is designing and building a mobile and cost-effective rendering plant which can process and convert insects into oil and meal for livestock which can meet regulatory requirements. 

## 2. Relevant Stakeholders

### 2.1. Project Team 

This project team consists of 4 undergraduate students with different engineering skills. All the members need to follow the ground rules in the group. Each member has their distinct roles and needs to be responsible for their sections. Other external stakeholders can direct contact with the member if they have any advice, concerns or questions toward one specific section.

### 2.2. Project Client

Our client is [Goterra Pty Ltd](https://www.goterra.com.au). The company is a organic waste management company. They believe that make a difference means doing things differently. Different with other organic waste processing technologies, Goterra farms insects, especially, Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia Illucens (BSF) to consume organic waste and Throughout the course of our process we harvest our larvae and frass to turn them into valuable agricultural commodities. The client team members are involved in this mobile insect processing plant design project are outlined in the table below.
