Our client is [Goterra Pty Ltd](https://www.goterra.com.au). The company is a organic waste management company. They believe that make a difference means doing things differently. Different with other organic waste processing technologies, Goterra farms insects, especially, Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia Illucens (BSF) to consume organic waste and Throughout the course of our process we harvest our larvae and frass to turn them into valuable agricultural commodities. The client team members are involved in this mobile insect processing plant design project are outlined in the table below.
