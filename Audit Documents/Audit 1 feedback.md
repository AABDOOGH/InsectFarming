F3: Our team are using engineering approach to tackle the challenge. 

#### 2.1.2.Aspects To Improve 
F1: Our of the team members mentaioned we need to start communicate with client and finish the function anlaysis and finish the first version of design. 

R1: Functional analysis is necessary to be done before the real design started. Our team will meet the client in Week 5 Wednesday. We will finalize the functional anlaysis during the meeting time. 

### 2.2.Decision Log
#### 2.2.1. Aspects Done Well 
F1: Our team believe the each deicsion making process is recorded in details, including  the date, ﬁnal decision and action item. In the next phase, as we select the best design after ideas generation. 

### 2.2.2.Aspects To Improve
F1: One thing we could improve is we can involve more audiences in the decision-making process. 

R1: We will involve more audiences in the designing phase decision. Now, our team are more focusing on researching and scoping the technologies and existing products. 


F2. Another thing we could do is we need to  look at the relevant standards and material speciﬁcations to support the decision on determine the material used to build the plant.

R1: In the functioanl anlaysis task (Week 4), we involved the  International standards and Australian standards toward to the manufacturing. In the future designing phase, we will reference more to support our decision on determing the material used to build the plant. 

### 2.3. Communication 
#### 2.3.1. Aspects Done Well 

F1: Our project team believed most part of our communication did well. Below, it shows some ideas we can imporve in the communication aspects. 

#### 2.3.2. Aspects To Improve 

F1. Now, we didn’t talk about our project with our shadow team or the other teams in our tutorials too much. It will be beneﬁcial to introduce our project with other peoples and listen to their suggestions and opinions on our design idea. In addition, I will recommend our team to discuss our project and seek for suggestions with someone who has plant design experience. 

R1: Our team do not have much communication with external audiences. In the week 5 tutorial, we will seek for more advice from tutor and shadow team. In addition, our team are planning to visit the rendering plant in NSW. Our team believe we could seek for more information and advice relating to designing. In addition, our team will try to communicate with experts who are woking the relevant industry and seek for advice from them. We are arranging a visit to a rendering plant to have more external communications. 

### 2.4. Teamwork 
#### 2.4.1. Aspects Done Well  
F1: Our team believe most parts of teamwork is good so far. Our group have set team ground rules to ensure the collaboration is effective. Each member in our group has designated specialist roles based on each members’ skills background. In addition, our client provided some useful information about the rendering process and technologies.

#### 2.4.2. Aspects To Improve 
F1. One thing we need to consider is the technical design task allocation. 

R1: Our team has already finished this task in week 4. 

### 2.5. Other Feedbacks 
F1. It might be better if we speak clearer and use more visualisation tool such as videos and graphs during the presentation. 


R1: In the next audit presentation, our team would use more visulisation tool in the presentation. This would be an effective way for audience to understand our project. 
## 3. Shadow Team Feedback 

### 3.1. Project Output 

#### 3.1.1. Aspects Done Well
F1: Our team has set clear goals. 

F2: The project team ground rules and responsibilities of each member is clear and transparent


#### 3.1.2. Aspects To Improve
F1. One of the suggestion from our shadow team is adding more information in the stakeholder analysis. 

R1: In our ConOps, we provide descriptions for each stakeholder, responsibilities and how stakholders interact with each other. We will communicate with our shadow team to find out what kind of additional information they required for the stakeholder anlysis.

F2: There is no project constraint section. 

R2: We will work out the project constraints and add in the ConOps. 

F3. Our shadow team recommand us to show the breakdown of the project cost. 

R3: The project scope is designing the mobile plant. Therefore, it will be a little bit hard to break down further more the project cost. We will communicate clients and tutor to figure out whether we ned to do the prototype. If our plan to do the prototype, we will figure out the detials for prototyping. 

### 3.2. Decision Log 

#### 3.2.1. Aspects Done Well 

F1: Our team involve client in the decision making process. 

#### 3.2.2. Aspects To Improve 

F1: One of the feedback is there is no decision log in excel spreadsheet form. Our shadow team recommend to use Excel spreadsheet to record the decision. The table form will will help us to see when the decision occurred and whether or not it was related to the previous decision. 

R1: Currently, there is no decision log in excel form in our repostiory is becuase we want note down every important points during the decision-making process. Thus, we created a file to record each decision, including, background, date, contributors, options considered, SWOT analysis for each option, outcome and action item. We think this might be helpful if we want to review the decision in for our team and the next team  who will take over our project in the next semester. They can have a better idea of why our team would like to do this decision. We will talk about this question with our tutor in the next tutorial and come back later.

F3: Our shadow team recommend it will be great if we can have something to indicate the follow-up process of the tasks assigned during the meeting. 


R3: Yes, we believe this could help to manage the tasks. Our team will create a work log for each person. Thus, we will create a task tracking file for the project to track the status for each allocated task. 

F4: Our shadow team suggest us to have more communication with experts in the relating industry. 

R4：Yes! It will be beneficial for our team if we could communicate with the experts. Our team is arranging the visit to the rendering plant. We beleive we could get lots of useful feedback from them. 


### 3.4. Teamwork 
#### 3.4.1. Aspects Done Well
F1: The responsibilities of all other stakeholders are well defined which is great

F2:  It is very clear which responsibilities fall on whom.

F4. ConOps has a clear goal and scope of your project, team roles and ground rules, stakeholders analysis, WBS, risk analysis, budget analysis and addresses some contingencies.

F5. Each team member knows their speciﬁc roles and what they are accountable for. Everyone appears to be contributing to your project, as reﬂected in your internal and client meeting minutes. 

F6. PA1 presentation was also very good with nice clear slides about your project. 


### 4.2. Aspects to Improve
F1.: It is important for you to see and experience in person how this process works.


R1: It will be definately beneficial for our team to see how the rendering plant work. Our team is planning the visit. 


F2: It would be better to also consider making some practical prototypes/experiments to help you validate and test your ideas for the three key sub systems (breaking/pre-cooking, continuous cooking, separation) of your proposed design.

R2:  We have discussed prototyping with our clients. Our client thought it might be not feasible for our team to produce the prototype in 12 weeks. Thus, we will discuss this question in the week 5 tutorial.
