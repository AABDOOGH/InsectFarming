## 2. Self Feedback 
### 2.1 Proejct Output 
Our team believed our team performance is good so far. 


### 2.2 Decision Log

Our team believe the each deicsion making process is recorded in details, including  the date, ﬁnal decision and action item. In the next phase, as we select the best design after ideas generation. 

One thing we could improve is we can involve more audiences in the decision-making process. 

### 2.3. Communication 

Our project team believed most part of our communication did well. Below, it shows some ideas we can imporve in the communication aspects. 

Now, we didn’t talk about our project with our shadow team or the other teams in our tutorials too much. It will be beneﬁcial to introduce our project with other peoples and listen to their suggestions and opinions on our design idea. In addition, I will recommend our team to discuss our project and seek for suggestions with someone who has plant design experience. 

### 2.4 Teamwork 

Our team believe most parts of teamwork is good so far. There are some points we can improve our teamwork. 

One thing we need to consider is the technical design task allocation. 

### 2.5 Other Feedbacks 
It might be better if we speak clearer and use more visualisation tool such as videos and graphs during the presentation. 

## 3. Shadow Team Feedback 

### 3.1 Project Output 
None. 

### 3.2 Decision Log 
Our shadow team do not find the decision log in excel form. 

### 3.3 Communication 

Our shadow team advice us two sections may be created for minute-taking, one is ‘New Action Items’, to record what the team may need to do after the meeting; and the other one is ‘Action Items from Previous Meeting’, to indicate what results the team has gotten, and if the items are completed or still in-progress. 

Our shaodw team advice us another folder may be created to input any external interaction ( with your clients or suppliers), especially for formal touches like email correspondence. 

Our shadow team recommend it will be great if we can have something to indicate the follow-up process of the tasks assigned during the meeting. 

### 3.4 Teamwork 

Our shadow team recommend to separate each person’s log book and count the weekly duration each member spent to give you guys a better representation of who is putting more work than the others. 

### 3.5 Other feedbacks 

If there can be a summary to indicate what is included in each file, it will be easy to access the repository. 


## 4. Tutor Feedback 

### 4.1. Aspects Done Well
Your landing page is also extremely very well presented. 
You have made a great start with your repository. 
Your documentation is of very high standard and concise with clear revision logs in all your key documents. 

Your ConOps has a clear goal and scope of your project, team roles and ground rules, stakeholders analysis, WBS, risk analysis, budget analysis and addresses some contingencies.

Each team member knows their speciﬁc roles and what they are accountable for. Everyone appears to be contributing to your project, as reﬂected in your internal and client meeting minutes. 

Your PA1 presentation was also very good with nice clear slides about your project. 


### 4.2 Aspects to Improve
It would in my opinion be important for you to see and experience in person how this process works.

You should also consider making some practical prototypes/experiments to help you validate and test your ideas for the three key sub systems (breaking/pre-cooking, continuous cooking, separation) of your proposed design.


## 5 Responses and Action Items 

### 5.1 Responses

#### 5.1.1 Project Output 

None 

#### 5.1.2 Decision Log 

1. One shadow feedback is there is no decision log in excel form. 

There is no decision log in excel form in our repostiory is becuase we want note down every important points during the decision-making process. Thus, we created a file to record each decision, including, background, date, contributors, options considered, SWOT analysis for each option, outcome and action item. We think this might be helpful if we want to review the decision in for our team and the next team  who will continue to do the project. 

2. In the future decision-making process, we will try to involve more audiences (experts) in the process. 

#### 5.1.3 Communication 


1. A folder will be created to show the external communication with our clients. 

2. In the furthre meeting minutes, we will add another section ‘Action Items from Previous Meeting’, to indicate what results the team has gotten, and if the items are completed or still in-progress. 

3. Our team will try to communicate with experts who are woking the relevant industry and seek for advice from them. 

4. Our team will arrange a visit to a rendering plant to have more external communications.
