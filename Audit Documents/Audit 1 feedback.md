### 4.1. Aspects Done Well
Your landing page is also extremely very well presented. 
You have made a great start with your repository. 
Your documentation is of very high standard and concise with clear revision logs in all your key documents. 

Your ConOps has a clear goal and scope of your project, team roles and ground rules, stakeholders analysis, WBS, risk analysis, budget analysis and addresses some contingencies.

Each team member knows their speciﬁc roles and what they are accountable for. Everyone appears to be contributing to your project, as reﬂected in your internal and client meeting minutes. 

Your PA1 presentation was also very good with nice clear slides about your project. 


### 4.2 Aspects to Improve

You should also consider making some practical prototypes/experiments to help you validate and test your ideas for the three key sub systems (breaking/pre-cooking, continuous cooking, separation) of your proposed design.
