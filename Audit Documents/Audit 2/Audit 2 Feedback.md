## 2. Self Feedback  
### 2.1. Project Output 

#### 2.1.1. Aspects Done well 
F1: We have completed 3D prototype of our model with accompanying TPM, functional anlaysis as well as improvement from shadow team and tutor feedback. 

#### 2.1.2. Aspects To Improve 
F1: We need to finish a more technically rigorous design and improve the TPM with proper reference. 

R1: Our team is almost finsh a version of more technically rigorous design and approved by the manufactuer. 

F2: We need to look at the real world testing through the use of sophisticated simulation software on the
structural and thermodynamic aspects of the design.

R2: The real world testing criteria cannot be applied to our project. Our project is a design project and we are only focusing on designing. For the feasibility test, we will contact with manufacturers and experts. Our team will not do the simulation to simulate the process. The process is standardized. There is no necessary to simulate the working process. It will be more beneficial if we could contact the expert and manufacture to ask for advice. 

F3: We need to do more design for the design ventillation system, accessibility and machine maintenance. 

R3: Our team has already finished the ventillation system. We also found a shipping container which only has the frame. This allow the maximum possibility to access and easily to maintenance. 

F4: We need to specify the specifications to be referenced and each document could be explained in detail with combination of requirements, government regulation, functionality and feasibility.

R4: In the document to explian the design, we will properly reference. 

F5: We need to finalize the technical peformance measurement. 

R5: Our team will do not the technical performance measurement. It is very hard to find the related standards which can specify the exact numbers. Now, we decide to do the design specifications and the actual values we can achieve. 

### 2.2. Decision Log
#### 2.2.1. Aspects Done Well 
F1: Clear lines of communication, detailed minutes and worklog, heavy stakeholder input (client input) with an extremely inclusive decision making process.

### 2.2.2. Aspects To Improve

No feedback. 

### 2.3. Communication 
#### 2.3.1. Aspects Done Well 
F1: We communicated with the stakeholders frequently. 

F2: We are communicating with industry experts for design advice. 

F3: We are also communicating with ANU PhD students to ask some advice for 3D drawings. 

F4: A variety of approaches was used to communicate effectively with clients. We have set up weekly meetings
with the clients. 

F5: We are contacting with manufacturers in China through Alibaba. He nearly answer all the questions we have during the design section.
#### 2.3.2. Aspects To Improve 
No feedbacks. 


### 2.4. Teamwork 
#### 2.4.1. Aspects Done Well  
F1: We have developed some new skills, such as sketchup and solidworks. 

F2: Everyone invovle in the project and being responsible for the technical design in the project. 

F3: We all contributed to the project and help each other with the tasks. 
#### 2.4.2. Aspects To Improve 

F1: We need a reviewer for the tasks. This need to ensure the quality of work. 

R1: We will assign one person to review the finished tasks. We will add another column "Review" in the task status. 

F1: Our team roles are already changed and we have not updated it. 

R1: We will assign the task and update the ConOps as soon as possible. 
### 2.5. reflections 

#### 2.5.1. Aspects Done Well 
F1: We have already summarized all the feedbacks from other stakeholders in terms of aspects well done and aspects to improve. Towrad to the feedback which we felt confused, we further communicate with our shadow team and tutor for clarification. 

F2: We also actively provide our opinions and suggestions for the other teams during presentation.
#### 2.5.2. Aspects To Improve  
No feedbakcs. 

## 3. Shadow Team Feedback 

### 3.1. Project Output 

#### 3.1.1. Aspects Done Well

F1: We have outputted preliminary rendering design, requirement analysis and functional analysis. 
#### 3.1.2. Aspects To Improve

F1: We need to show the design to the client. 

R1: We have already show the design to the client. Client is satisfied with the design. 

F1: One shadow member recommand us to 3D print the system. 

R1: We do not think it is necessary and beneficial to 3D print the system. We will communicate with our tutor and shodown team in Week 7 tutorial. 

F1: Shadown team recommand us to invovle research paper when we design the process. 

R1: At this stage, we nearly finished the design section. In the improving stage, we will find more research paper to support the decision making to improve the design. 

### 3.2. Decision Log 

#### 3.2.1. Aspects Done Well 
No feedbacks. 
 

#### 3.2.2. Aspects To Improve 
No feedbacks. 



### 3.3. Communication 
#### 3.3.1. Aspects Done Well
F1: We have recorded every client meeting and group meeting. 

F2: We have recorded all the important emails between client and group. 

F3: We are communicating with industry experts and manufacturers. 
#### 3.3.2. Aspects To Improve 
F1: We need to separate client meeting and group meeting. 

R1:We probably will not separate the client and group meeting minutes. In the title of each meeting minutes, we have already marked whethere this is client meeting or group meeting. So, we think this is clear enough

F2: Expert communication need to properly written down. 

R2: We will write a proper document to introduce the experts and all the important points in the communication.  

### 3.4. Teamwork 
#### 3.4.1. Aspects Done Well
F1: We evenly distributed tasks. 

F2: Our team has a proper assignent of roles. 
#### 3.4.2. Aspects To Improve 
F1: We do not have discussion in the meeting minutes. 

R1: We think we have properly written down the discussion results. We will talk with shadown team in the tutorial session. 

F2: Our shadow team advice us to have a style of cross-field involvemnet of each member. 

R2: In our team, we indeed have a style of cross-field invovlement fir each member. Everyone contribute to the technical design. Everyone is resposibible for more than one field in the project. We will update the role in our ConOps as soon as possible. 

F3: Our shadow team recommand to provide the personality results to examine the member strength and weakness to tailor the teamwork. 

R3: Our team will not add the personality results. This is becuase everyone has cross-field involvement in the project. Everyone contribute to all the aspects in the project. Everyone nearly has equally responsbile to the project. Thus, the personality test will not provide much benefits.  



### 3.5. reflections 

#### 3.5.1. Aspects Done Well 
F1: WE repsect every constructive feedbacks and summarized them properly in a document. 

F2: We ask question to help other teams. 

#### 3.5.2. Aspects To Improve
No feedbacks.

F2: We take action on feedback we received in PA1. 


### 4.2. Aspects to Improve

F1: Stability and support struture are some issues. 

R1: Our team is working on this part. 

F2: It will be beneficial if we could get some feedbacks from experts and other stakehodlers. 

R2: Yes, this will be valuable if we could get some feedbacks from experts. Now, we are contacting the manufactures and seek for feedback to improve our design. 

F3: It is good if we can visit the rendering plant. 

R3: Our client is communicating with the rendering plant and we have not get any responses. We will try to contact them and see whether we could get responses. 


## 5. Client Feedbacks

F1: The team has taken a client centric approach to development and product co-design. 

F2: The team have taken a holistic systems approach to product design and have been responsive to the needs of the external client.



## 6. Action Items 


| Action items           | Contributor        | Status          | 
| :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | 
|Update roles for each member|Minghui |In progress|
|Finish the ventilation system design|All team|Completed|
|Email the rendering plant and fnind out whether we could have a visit| All team| In progress|
|Stability and support structual deisgn| All team |In progress|
|Add a column "Review" in the task status| Minghui |In progress|


## 7. Additional Feedbacks in Week 5 Tutorial

It is totally fine if we do not 3D print the deisgn. 

For the rendering deisgn visit, we could send emails by ourselves and seek for responses.
