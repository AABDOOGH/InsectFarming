## 1. Relevant Stakeholders

### 1.1. Project Team 

This project team consists of 4 undergraduate students with different engineering skills. All the members need to follow the ground rules in the group. Each member has their distinct roles and needs to be responsible for their sections. Other external stakeholders can have direct contact with the member if they have any advice, concerns or questions toward one specific section.

- Project team ground rules
  * All team members need to communicate and treat each other with respect.
  * All team members need to attend meetings on time. If any group members cannot attend meeting, please let others know.  
  * All team members need to value feedback from team members and other stakeholders; avoid being defensive about giving and receiving any constructive feedback.
  * All team members need to communicate task progress regularly, try to finish the assigned tasks on time based on the deadline set in the milestone. 

- Responsibilities of the Mechanism engineers to the project 
  * Finish the conceptual design based on research conducted. 
  * Use CAD software to draw the schematic diagrams of the designed mobile rendering process. 
  * Use finite-element-analysis tool (COMSOL Multiphysics) to simulate the machine-working-process and ensure the mobile plant can process insects into meals and oils that meet regulatory requirements.
  
- Responsibilities of the research and repository manager to the project 
  * Do the required technical research about the rendering process.
  * Do financial research about the whole designed rendering process and obtain the budget of the final proposed prototype.
  * Manage the repository and upload all the files and documents related to the project.
  
 - Responsibilities of administrator to the project 
   * Set and lead weekly regular group meetings.
   * Maintain contacts with clients and arrange regularly meeting between the project team and clients.
   * Document key points in each meetings and upload documentation to repository. 
   * Ensure all the project goals and milestones are achieved and not behind schedule.
  
### 1.2. Project Client

Our client is [Goterra Pty Ltd](https://www.goterra.com.au). The company is a organic waste management company. They believe that in order to make a difference, things need to be done differently. Different from other organic waste processing technologies, Goterra farms insects, especially the Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia Illucens (BSF) to consume organic waste and throughout the course of our process, harvest larvae and frass to turn them into valuable agricultural commodities. The client team members that are involved in this mobile insect processing plant design project are outlined in the table below.

| Name           | Role                  | Contact                   | Key interaction with the Project                           |
| :------------: |:-------------:        | :-----:                   | ------                                                 |
| Olympia Yarger | Founder and CEO       | olympia@goterra.com.au    | Provides the defination and objectives of the project and guides on the project progress |
| Jiefei Wang    | Robotics Engineer     | jiefei@goterra.com.au     | Provides relevant technical supervisation and assistance |
| Martin Amidy   | On behalf of Olympia  | martin.amidy@anu.edu.au   | Regularlly provides feedback and supervision during the project ongoing period and builds the connection between our project team and the project client |
 
- Responsibilities of the project team to the client
  * Design a low-cost mobile insect processing plant in regards to the client baseline requirements.
  * Regularly report the project progress and other relative information (such as reasonable delays and potential risks). 
  * According to the design, estimate a financial budget analysis (including the product lifecycle and potential cost of the build of the plant).   

- Responsibilities of the client to the project
  * To define the objectives of the project. 
  * Provide feedback to the project team timely.
  * Provide relevent and necessary technical supervision and assistance.
  * Be able to attend the regularly set meeting. 
 
### 1.3. Third Party Supervisors

The third party supervisors in the project are the course convenor and tutor of [ENGN4221](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/engn4221) at Australian National University. The purpose of the course is to engage the students to solve a practical industrial design problem with application of the learnt systematic and techincal knowledge. Whilst doing the project, the development of communication skills, professional skills, team work management will be expected.

| Name           | Role                  | Contact                   | Key interaction with the Project                           |

| Ankur Sharma   | Course Convenor       | ankur.sharma@anu.edu.au   | Provide feedback on the different stages of the project and give systematic gudiance on how to do the project |
| Jani Sega      | Course Tutor          | jani.sega@anu.edu.au      | Provide feedback on the different stages of the project and give systematic gudiance on how to do the project | 

- Responsibilities of the project team to the third party supervisors
  * Provide the detailed information in regards to the assessment guidance about the project progress towards the milestone.
  * Attend the regular tutorials and do the presentations that talk about the project.
  * Submit the required documents on time.

- Responsibilities of the third party supervisors to the project
  * Provide feedback on the different stages of the project.
  * Provide systematic gudiance on how to do the project.
  * Estabilish the connection between the project team and project client.
  * Assist the project team to complete the project and let the project be beneficial to the client.
  * Have capacity on the communication, such as email and appointment.

### 1.4. Shadow Team

The shadow team is another stakeholder in the project, who is enroled in the same tutorial slot as our project team. The shadow team has access to review all project information and will regularly provide feedback on each stages of project. Our project progress may inspire them and their recommendations may also be useful on the improvments of the project.

- Responsibilities of the project team to the shadow team
  * Provide shadow team the required access to our team project respositories.
  * Communicate appropriately with shadow team. 

- Responsibilities of the shadow team to the project
  * Provide feedback on the project timely.

### 1.5. Potential Customers

Potential customers (and the targets) of our project product will be insect farms and other organic waste management companies. Goterra has clients from government, councils, hotels, hospitals, restaurants and households.  

Potential customers have no responsibilities to the project, but their requirements are one of the most important factors to be considered in the process of designing the mobile insect processing plant.
