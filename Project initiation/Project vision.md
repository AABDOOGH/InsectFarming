## 1. Project Vision 

This project aims to produce mobile and cost-effective rendering plant, capable of processing insects into meals and oils that meet regulatory requirements. The goal for this semester is to finish the designing part of the project.

### 1.1 Value proposition 

Population increases have dramatically risen in recent years, and with it increased consumption of food. One crucial component in human's dietary structure, protein, requires people to expand the soybean cultivation to feed livestock. One alternative solution is to farm insects in order to provide an alternative food resource to livestock. Current regulations require the animal products, which are used in agriculture feeds, to be processed in modern rendering plants. However, the existing rendering plants cannot process the insects economically, due to the small-scale nature of insect farming industry in Australia. Thus, this project is aiming to design a mobile, micro processing plant which can process insects cost-effectively.  

### 1.2 Project Scope 

The project scopes are divided into three parts and summarized below.
* Design the micro-scale rendering plant based on research. 
* Use CAD software to draw the schematic drawing of the designed micro-processing rendering plant. 
* Use FEA software to simulate the working process of the plant and make sure the designed plant can technically work properly and meet the stakeholder requirements. 
* Conduct economic analysis to calculate the budget for building a prototype plant. 


### 1.3 Key achievement 
The expected achievement in this project is designing and building a mobile and cost-effective rendering plant. It need to be able to process and convert insects into oil and meal for livestock which can meet regulatory requirements. The key achievement in this semester is to finalize the designing part of the project.
