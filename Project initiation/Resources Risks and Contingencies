## 1. Resources Risks and Contingencies

Large amounts of heat, pressure and liquid are involved in the rendering process. While better manageable in a factory setting, with infrastructural ventilation and cooling, doing the same processes in a small scale space will require thorough understanding of the thermodynamic systems taking place. 
This is of course to minimize the resources needed to complete the project, the possible risks faced,  and allows accurate understanding of the contingencies needed to prevent them.

### 3.1. Project Costs

The goal of this project is to deliver a preliminary design for a movable, compact, insect meal rendering plant, with actual prototyping and final design to be completed over a "to be determined" period of time beyond 2019. The costs associated with the first stage of this process will therefore be minimal, as most of the project work will revolve around building simulated designs using different software tools, as well as conducting market research with different industry partners, and having discussions with foreign manufacturers and merchants. 

The projected budget is therefore as follows:

| Resource needed | Bearer | Estimated Cost (AUS $) |
| :-------:   | :-------  | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Labour | ANU | N/A |
| Software Resources | ANU | N/A |
| Transport | Gotera/ANU | 50 |
| Prototyping| ANU| 500
| Total | | 550 |

### 1.2. Project Outcome Risks

The integrated nature of the final design, has with it accompanying risks that all pose their own different levels of importance. These risks can be relegated into two categories: Financial and Material Risks, each with their own set of contigencies that will aim to minimize their probability and impact.

#### 1.2.1. Financial Risks

As the categoriy suggests, these are risks that result due to poor research and design, which result in either mismanaged funds or wasted capital expenditure. 

The most significant of these are as follows:

| Risk | Description                                                  |
| :-------:   | :----------------------------------------------------------  |
| Innacurate Cost Projections | Some of the costing done of the equipment and general infrastructure of the unit will require estimates based on what information is publicly available or readily obtainable. If these project costs are innacurate, and they move through into the final design, it may end up maaking the plant too expensive too produce, with the addition ofa possible re-start near the beginning of the design process. | 
| Over-Engineered Design| A key stakeholder requirement is that the costs of the final design be kept as low as possible, and as efficient as possible. If the final design has built-in ineffcencies, this equates to over-spending on equipment, and therefore must be avoided.|
| Poorly Engineered Design | The worst case scenario in which both of the above scenarios may take place, as well as the additional issue that the final design is not fit for purpose, most likely resulting in acquisition of large amounts of capital that has no function.|

#### 1.2.2. Material Risks

These risks pertain to the physical nature of the rendering plant and its associated processes. 

| Risk | Description                                                  |
| :-------:   | :----------------------------------------------------------  |
| Inadequate Cooling | The large amounts of heat produced by the rendering process will require effective cooling methods to ensure no damage can result to the equipment integrated togethor in the confined area, while also ensuring the safety of any human operators nearby or when scheduled maintenace takes place |
| Pressure Build-Up | The confined space that the process will be housed in may result in gradual pressure build-up, due to the heat and gasses used to seperate the meal from the tallow. If left un-mitigated, damage can occur to not only the equipment housed inside the module, but also to any humans near the unit when the pressure is violently released, whether in the form of an explosion(s) or super heated gasses.|
| Inadequate Supporting Structure | The housing that the plant will be placed in needs to not only protect the equipment, but also ensure that weight distribution is even, peripheral equipment such as conveyer belts and pipes are properly supported, no piece of equipment can interfere with the function of another, and that movement of the module will not cause damage to the equipment housed inside (as mobility of the rendering plant is a key stakeholder requirement).|
| Limited Access | The design of the plant and housing needs to support accessability to the equipment and all supporting infrastructure, in order to ensure regular maintenance and repairs, minimizing some of the hazardous risks explained above.|

### 1.3. Contingencies

As demonstrated, the risks the project in general faces are widespread and feature not only in the physical space but in the financial one as well. There are therefore contingencies that need to be placed to ensure that the design process minimizes the probability of each of the afformentioned risks, ensuring the highest probability of success for the project.

Instituting key aspects into the design process is therefore crucial, with those being identified as:
<ul><li> A Central Control System: This will observe all sensor data measured in the plant to notify any operators of potential hazards that need to be mitigated. 
</li><li> Modular Design: Ensuring that any design is modular (while also fostering integration) will allow easy access, as well as assist in cooling and ventilating the plant.
</li><li> Stepped Design and Review Process: This will assure proof of concept, minimizing the financial risks mentioned, as well as producing the best overall desing that meets the stakeholder requirements.
